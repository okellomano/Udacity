# Ford GoBike Data Exploration
## by Okello Edward


## Dataset

> This document shows the exploration of Ford GoBike dataset. The data includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Fransisco Bay area. Some of the attributes in the dataset include start_time and end_time of the trip, day and time of the trip, user types, age of the riders etc.
During the investigation, data cleaning was done. I dropped rows with missing data for member_birth_year, member_gende, start_station and end_station data. I also extracted other features like riders' age, day and time of the ride from the start time and member birth year.After a succesfull cleaning, I visualized the data and gained more insights.
